Repository for UCLA Extension Data Science Certification course related to Project #6 on using Python Data to investigvate what variables predict the long-term home appreciation of a city in Part A. This part involves plotting correlation charts and sns.barplots to visualize the data. It also requires linear regression modeling and making in-sample predictions using the linear regression model. Part B involves using the Churn data from https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn. Data visualization and exploratory data analysis is done. The sm.Logit library is used to run logistic regression models. This part also requires displaying confusion matrices, ROC curves, and accuracy/precision/recall/F1 metrics. Part C involves running different classification machine learning models with 10-fold cross validation from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data. The models include Logit, NBayes, LDA, QDA, KNN, SVM, Tree, RF, and XGB.
